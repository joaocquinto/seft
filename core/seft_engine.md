# SEFT Engine – Symbolic Evaluation Logic

This document describes how to compute symbolic emotional fusion using the SEFT model.

---

## 🧮 Core Formula

Fusion = 1 + 1 = 1 ⇔ (Ve + CSS ≥ 0.95) ∧ (Δ ≤ 2.0) ∧ (𝕎𝕂 = true)

---

## 🔷 Components

| Symbol | Meaning                             | Range        |
|--------|-------------------------------------|--------------|
| E      | Empathy                             | 0.0 – 3.0    |
| C      | Trust                               | 0.0 – 3.0    |
| D      | Emotional commitment                | 0.0 – 3.0    |
| Ve     | Composite = (0.3×E) + (0.4×C) + (0.3×D) | 0.0 – 3.0 |
| CSS    | Subjective Synchrony Coefficient     | –0.2 – +0.2  |
| Δ      | Existential Difference               | 0.0 – ∞      |
| 𝕎𝕂     | Emotional Truth Verification         | ≥ 4/5 `true` |

## ✅ Fusion Validation Conditions

Fusion is confirmed only when:

1. `Ve + CSS ≥ 0.95`  
2. `Δ ≤ 2.0`  
3. `WK_check` contains **at least 4 `true` values**

---

## 💡 Implementation Ideas

- Accept inputs via JSON  
- Run logic as a simple conditional chain  
- Return fusion result as boolean and reason diagnostics  
- Apply to affective agents, empathy evaluators, or symbolic simulations

---

## 🧠 Example: Fusion Confirmed

Given valid inputs, the system returns:

```json
{
  "Fusion": true,
  "Reason": "All conditions satisfied: Ve + CSS = 2.54, Delta = 1.6, WK = true"
}
```
