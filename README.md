# Symbolic Emotional Fusion Theory (SEFT)

**SEFT is a symbolic protocol for emotional authenticity — computational, interpretable, and deeply human-centered.**

It is a symbolic, computable model for evaluating the authenticity of emotional bonds between agents — human or artificial.

This repository contains documentation, JSON input/output samples, and future tools for developers and researchers working in affective computing, symbolic AI, therapy engines, and social simulations.

## 🔷 Core Equation

Fusion = 1 + 1 = 1 ⇔ (Ve + CSS ≥ 0.95) ∧ (Δ ≤ 2.0) ∧ (𝕎𝕂 = true)

Where:

- `Ve` is a weighted composite of Empathy (E), Trust (C), and Emotional Commitment (D)
- `Δ` is existential distance
- `CSS` is subjective synchrony
- `𝕎𝕂` is the validation of emotional truth based on a 5-point checklist
