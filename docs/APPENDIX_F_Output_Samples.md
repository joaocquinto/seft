# APPENDIX F – Output Samples (SEFT Response Format)

This appendix presents example outputs for the Symbolic Emotional Fusion Theory (SEFT) when implemented in a digital system. The output format is structured in `JSON`, suitable for integration in affective AI, therapy tools, simulations, or symbolic diagnostic systems.

---

## Format

All outputs follow the standard JSON format with boolean and numeric fields. Validations are based on SEFT's formal logic:

- `Ve + CSS ≥ 0.95`
- `Delta ≤ 2.0`
- `WK_check` must contain at least 4 values set to `true`

---

## ✅ Case 1 – Fusion Confirmed

### Input – Case 1

```json
{
  "E": 2.5,
  "C": 2.4,
  "D": 2.6,
  "Delta": 1.6,
  "CSS": 0.05,
  "WK_check": [true, true, true, true, true]
}
```

### Output – Case 1

```json
{
  "Fusion": true,
  "Reason": "All conditions satisfied: Ve + CSS = 2.54, Delta = 1.6, WK = true"
}
```

---

## ❌ Case 2 – Fusion Denied

### Input – Case 2

```json
{
  "E": 1.9,
  "C": 1.8,
  "D": 2.0,
  "Delta": 1.2,
  "CSS": 0.10,
  "WK_check": [true, false, true, true, false]
}
```

### Output – Case 2

```json
{
  "Fusion": false,
  "Reason": [
    "Ve + CSS too low: 0.88 < 0.95",
    "WK_check failed: only 3 out of 5"
  ]
}
```

---

## Notes

- `Fusion: true` is only returned if all three logical conditions are met.
- The `Reason` field provides symbolic diagnostic information useful for analysis and system response.
- This output format can be integrated into chatbots, therapy AIs, affective simulations, and research applications in HCI and symbolic AI.

## Suggested Applications

- Affective AI validation modules  
- Empathy-based agent systems  
- Digital relationship checkers  
- Symbolic diagnostic simulations  
- Teaching tools in computational psychology
